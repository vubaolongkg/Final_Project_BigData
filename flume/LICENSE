      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Creative Commons Legal Code

CC0 1.0 Universal

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.

    license.

    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
    TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER

    LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
    APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
    PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
    AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

    The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
    software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §
    252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation"
    as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
    with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
    (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
    with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
    clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
    clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
    software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
    the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
    the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
    provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
    provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
    to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
    venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
    with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
    limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
    The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
    the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
    regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
    construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
    agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
    States export administration regulations (and the export control
    laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
    or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

2.	Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions.   Subject to the terms and
conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You
accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and
copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:

2.1	Unmodified Code.  You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally
distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim, unmodified
copies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided
that in each instance:

(a)	You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the
copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear
in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that
refer to this License; and

(b) 	You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code
of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You
may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict
this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under
Section 6.

2.2	Modified Code.  You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce, display,
perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy
Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes,
provided that in each instance You also meet all of these conditions:

(a)	You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the
Source Code of the Covered Code; 

(b)	You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice
in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and
cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the
files and the date of any change; and

(c)	If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code
of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom
You have Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available.  Source
Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms
set forth in this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3
below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12)
months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is longer. You
should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally Deployed
Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site).

2.3	Distribution of Executable Versions.  In addition, if You Externally
Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code,
executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as
well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code
is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where
to obtain such Source Code.  

2.4	Third Party Rights.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that although
Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of
the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any
Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor
disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to
distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license
before distributing the Covered Code.

3.	Your Grants.  In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses
granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity
receiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive,
royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent
Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or
controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense,
distribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent
as Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.  

4.	Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code
with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
Larger Work as a single product.  In each such instance, You must make sure the
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion
thereof. 

5.	Limitations on Patent License.   Except as expressly stated in Section
2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein.
Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from
Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.  

6.	Additional Terms.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights
consistent with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to
one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any
Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional
Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and
hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or
claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such
Additional Terms. 

7.	Versions of the License.  Apple may publish revised and/or new versions
of this License from time to time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing
version number.  Once Original Code has been published under a particular
version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that
version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any
subsequent version of this License published by Apple.  No one other than Apple
has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
License.  

8.	NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT.  The Covered Code may contain in whole or in
part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works.  The Covered Code may
contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete
or contain inaccuracies.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the
Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk.  THE
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF
ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE"
FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY
QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT,
AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT
WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE
FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE
OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT
DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION
OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR
SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.  You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended
for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation,
communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure
of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or
environmental damage.

9.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO
EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR
YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER
UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS
LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL
PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages
(other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the
amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

10.	Trademarks.  This License does not grant any rights to use the
trademarks or trade names  "Apple", "Mac", "Mac OS", "QuickTime", "QuickTime
Streaming Server" or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names
belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service
mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor.  You agree not to use any
Apple Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code
or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as
expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple's third
party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at
http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.  

11.	Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each
Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications
made by such Contributor.  Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and
to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple
Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject
to this License.  Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such
Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those
contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.  

12.	Termination.  

12.1	Termination.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate:

(a)	automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any
term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming
aware of such breach; (b)	immediately in the event of the circumstances
described in Section 13.5(b); or (c)	automatically without notice from Apple
if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for
patent infringement against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an
action for patent infringement against You in that instance.

12.2	Effect of Termination.  Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop
any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of
the Covered Code.  All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly
granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License.
Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the
termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections
3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13.  No party will be liable to any other for
compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating
this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will
be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.

13. 	Miscellaneous.

13.1	Government End Users.   The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as
defined in FAR 2.101.  Government software and technical data rights in the
Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as
defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and
software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212
(Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015
(Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial
Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation).  Accordingly, all U.S.
Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth
herein.

13.2	Relationship of Parties.  This License will not be construed as creating
an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association
between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to
the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.

13.3	Independent Development.   Nothing in this License will impair Apple's
right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or
distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as,
or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products
that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.

13.4	Waiver; Construction.  Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce
any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement
of that or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which provides that the
language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to
this License.

13.5	Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable,
that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible
so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the
remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect.  (b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from
fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the
enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately
terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and
destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.

13.6	Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution between
You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District
of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of,
and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to
this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

13.7	Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  This
License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of
California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law. 

Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause
applies:  The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License
and all related documents be drafted in English.  Les parties ont exigÃ© que le
prÃ©sent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rÃ©digÃ©s en anglais.

Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

This product includes (via Snappy Java) a statically linked libstdc++. This
inclusion is allowed by  "GCC RUntime Library Exception" 


GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.
    

Hopefully that text is self-explanatory. If it isn't, you need to speak to your lawyer, or the Free Software Foundation.
